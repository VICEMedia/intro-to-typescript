# Intro to TypeScript

## Prerequisites

Make sure you are running Node 8.x or later. You can use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to update to the LTS version of Node 8.

It is highly recommended you use a text editor that supports TypeScript intellisense. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) comes with this functionality out of the box.
