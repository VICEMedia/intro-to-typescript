# Before we get started

Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js (v8.x+) installed (we recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to update to a recent version)

Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a TypeScript Intellisense plugin for your favorite text editor.

```bash
$ git clone github.com/VICEMedia/intro-to-typescript
$ cd intro-to-typescript
$ npm install
```

# TypeScript

TypeScript is a transpiled programming language that adds a type system to JavaScript.

---

<CodeSurfer
  title='TypeScript -> JavaScript transpilation'
  code={ require('!raw-loader!./snippets/transpilation-example.ts' )}
  lang='typescript'
  steps={[
    { range: [1, 19], notes: 'TypeScript code' },
    { range: [21, 31], notes: 'Transpiled JavaScript code' },
  ]}
/>

<CodeSurfer

  code={ require('!raw-loader!./snippets/compiler-error.ts') }
  lang='typescript'
  steps={[
    { notes: 'Before your code can be run by a JavaScript engine, it needs to be transpiled from TypeScript to JavaScript.', lines: [1, 2] },
    { notes: 'During this process, the transpiler performs type checks and will throw an error if anything looks off.', lines: [4] },
  ]}

## Collaboration

When working on larger projects, not all members of a team may have complete knowledge of the codebase. TypeScript helps contributors glean the input and output of a function and infer what a data structure should look like in order for a part of the application to function properly.

---

# Drawbacks

* Transpiled JavaScript
* Additional overhead when writing code
* Additional overhead when debugging code

---

# This lesson will cover

* the type system & type annotations
* type inference
* writing & implementing interfaces
* any types & type assertions
* using npm to fetch type definitions for a package
* creating an Express app from the ground up using TypeScript

# The Type System

<CodeSurfer
  title='Common types'
  code={ require('!raw-loader!./snippets/types-example.ts') }
  lang='typescript'
  steps={[
    { notes: 'Common types' },
    { lines: [1, 2], notes: 'boolean' },
    { lines: [4, 5, 6, 7], notes: 'number' },
    { lines: [9, 10], notes: 'string' },
    { lines: [12, 13], notes: 'array' },
  ]}

# Type inference

The TypeScript compiler will predict the type annotations for a given variable based upon possible values for that variable

```notes
This slide should inclide a short live demo of type inference in action
```

---

# Interfaces

Interfaces are used to describe the structure of an object.

Interfaces can be implemented by classes or by objects.

```notes
This is a good opportunity to check familiarity with interfaces
```

---

# What is an 'any' type?

An `any` type is used to describe the type of a variable that we are unsure of at the time of writing.

`any` is helpful when migrating an existing JavaScript application onto TypeScript.

```notes
any can also be a helpful way of getting the transpiler to compile your code while developing a feature
```

---

# Writing and implementing an interface

```notes
This is a live coding section
```

---

# NPM packages and @types

Type annotations for NPM packages can be downloaded by using the `@types/` prefix. Let's use [request promise native](https://github.com/request/request-promise-native) as an example

```bash
$ npm install --save request
$ npm install --save request-promise-native
$ npm install --save @types/request-promise-native
```

```notes
This slide should include a quick live demo of the downloaded types working in VS Code
```

---

# Let's make an Express app

* write a `/roll-call` route that responds with all monsters' names
* add a `Food` enum and give each monster an array of `foodSources`
* write a `/:name/feed?foodSource=brains&units=2` route which checks if the food you feed a monster is valid
* add an `Attack` enum and give each monster an array of `weaknesses`
* write a `/:name/attack?source=stake` route which checks to see if the monster can be defeated by the attack and deletes it if the attack succeeds
* BONUS: add unit tests using Mocha/Chai
* BONUS: save your monsters to MongoDB or a database of your choice

```notes
This slide will be a code-along in which we get the basic application set up, and then students will go off and work on their own

Install dependencies

npm init
npm install --save typescript
npm install --save express

mkdir src
touch src/app.ts

Start writing app.get and pause to get type annotations

npm install --save-dev @types/express

Finish writing app.get with a simple 'Hello' response and add app.listen

Setup tsconfig.json and then package.json start command

npm install --save-dev nodemon
touch nodemon.json

Update package.json to use the nodemon config

Setup hashmap of monsters
```
